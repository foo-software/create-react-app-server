Create React App Server provides server side rendering as a standalone process. Create React App Server is a Node.js [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web server. It accepts Express options and more. It serves static files from a Create React App build. It parses client side rendered HTML, writes output to HTML files on disk, and caches the relationship in memory so proceeding requests are served a static file without heavy lifting.

For complete documentation, including usage go to the [main project README](https://github.com/foo-software/create-react-app-server).
